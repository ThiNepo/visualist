Description: # Visualist
        
        This is a very simple lilbrary to visualize lists in Python. 
        
        It was created mainly to support the creation of tutoriais for [Neps Academy](https://neps.academy/) (amazing website :D).
        
        ### Usage
        
        The minimal example is shown below. 
        
        ```json
        from visualist import draw_list
        
        img = draw_list([1, 2, -4, 2], [2])
        img.show()
        ```
        
        The result of this code would be
        
        ![example](https://neps.academy/image/374.png)
        
        Showing a list [1, 2, -4, 2] and highlighting the index 2.
        
        #### Building the library
        
        To build the library you need the **wheel** module:
        
        ```
        pip install wheel
        ```
        
        and run the following command:
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
