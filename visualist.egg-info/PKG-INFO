Description: # Visualist
        
        This is a very simple library to visualize lists in Python. 
        
        It was created mainly to support the creation of tutorials for [Neps Academy](https://neps.academy/) (amazing website :D).
        
        ### Usage
        
        The minimal example is shown below. It supposes that we want to create an image 640x180 pixels from the list [1, 2, -4, 2, -2, 5] and highlight the indexes [2, 4].
        
        ```python
        from visualist import Visualist
        
        visualist = Visualist((640, 180))
        
        img = visualist.img_from_list([1, 2, -4, 2, -2, 5], [2, 4])
        
        img.show()
        ```
        
        The result of this code would be
        
        ![example](https://neps.academy/image/375.png)
        
        If you want to save the image change `img.show()` to `img.save('my_dear_list.png')`.
        
        #### Building the library
        
        To build the library you need the **wheel** module:
        
        ```
        pip install wheel
        ```
        
        and run the following command:
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
